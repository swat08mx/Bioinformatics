Deathstar.py is a tool currently in development that can be used specifically to analyze the outputs from the tool CNVkit, this tool takes the cnr files, preferentially from a cohort and processess them together to generate plots for easier visualization of alterations in the genome, one has to put their gene list as in an array and feed it to the loop, along with the cnr files, most of the other tasks are automated, except in some places where manual ovveride is needed to filter amplifications and deletions based on the z score methods and to change the thresholds as needed by the user.
